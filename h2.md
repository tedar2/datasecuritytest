### x) Read and summarize - OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

A05:2021 is a reference to OWASP Top 10 A1:2017, which is a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. "Security Misconfiguration" refers to a security vulnerability caused by inadequate or incorrect configuration of web application components such as the web server, application server, database server, or framework. Examples of security misconfiguration include:

+ Default accounts with well-known, easy-to-guess passwords
+ Unrestricted access to error messages containing sensitive information
+ Unsecured default configurations of application components
+ Unpatched vulnerabilities in software components

To mitigate security misconfiguration risks, it's important to follow best practices for configuring and securing web applications, such as:

+ Removing or disabling default accounts and changing passwords
+ Configuring error handling to not reveal sensitive information
+ Keeping software components up to date with security patches
+ Regularly reviewing and testing security configurations.

 Preventing security misconfiguration involves implementing secure installation processes, using a minimal platform without unnecessary features, regularly reviewing configurations and applying security updates, having a segmented application architecture, sending security directives to clients, and using automated processes to verify configuration effectiveness. Common attack scenarios for security misconfiguration include leaving sample applications with known security flaws on the production server, not disabling directory listing on the server, allowing detailed error messages to be returned to users, and having open sharing permissions on cloud storage.

### A06:2021 â€“ Vulnerable and Outdated Components

A06:2021 refers to OWASP Top 10 A1:2017, which is a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. "Vulnerable and Outdated Components" refers to the use of software components with known vulnerabilities, such as outdated libraries, frameworks, and plugins. These components may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or compromise the application.

To prevent vulnerable and outdated components, organizations should have a patch management process in place, including:

+ Removing unused components
+ Continuously inventorying and monitoring the versions of client and server components, and subscribing to email alerts for related security vulnerabilities.
+ Obtaining components only from official sources over secure links.
+ Monitoring for libraries and components that are unmaintained or lack security patches.
+ Having an ongoing plan for monitoring, applying updates, and fixing vulnerabilities.

Example attack scenarios:

+ Components run with the same privileges as the application, which makes them a target for exploitation if they have flaws (e.g. a coding error or a backdoor).
+ Vulnerable components like CVE-2017-5638 can result in serious impact like remote code execution.
+ Devices like IoT devices can be difficult or impossible to patch and can be a security concern.
+ Attackers can use automated tools like Shodan IoT to find unpatched or misconfigured systems.
