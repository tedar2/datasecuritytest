### x) Read and summarize - OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

A05:2021 is a reference to OWASP Top 10 A1:2017, which is a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. "Security Misconfiguration" refers to a security vulnerability caused by inadequate or incorrect configuration of web application components such as the web server, application server, database server, or framework. Examples of security misconfiguration include:

+ Default accounts with well-known, easy-to-guess passwords
+ Unrestricted access to error messages containing sensitive information
+ Unsecured default configurations of application components
+ Unpatched vulnerabilities in software components

To mitigate security misconfiguration risks, it's important to follow best practices for configuring and securing web applications, such as:

+ Removing or disabling default accounts and changing passwords
+ Configuring error handling to not reveal sensitive information
+ Keeping software components up to date with security patches
+ Regularly reviewing and testing security configurations.

 Preventing security misconfiguration involves implementing secure installation processes, using a minimal platform without unnecessary features, regularly reviewing configurations and applying security updates, having a segmented application architecture, sending security directives to clients, and using automated processes to verify configuration effectiveness. Common attack scenarios for security misconfiguration include leaving sample applications with known security flaws on the production server, not disabling directory listing on the server, allowing detailed error messages to be returned to users, and having open sharing permissions on cloud storage.

### A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

A06:2021 refers to OWASP Top 10 A1:2017, which is a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. "Vulnerable and Outdated Components" refers to the use of software components with known vulnerabilities, such as outdated libraries, frameworks, and plugins. These components may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or compromise the application.

To prevent vulnerable and outdated components, organizations should have a patch management process in place, including:

+ Removing unused components
+ Continuously inventorying and monitoring the versions of client and server components, and subscribing to email alerts for related security vulnerabilities.
+ Obtaining components only from official sources over secure links.
+ Monitoring for libraries and components that are unmaintained or lack security patches.
+ Having an ongoing plan for monitoring, applying updates, and fixing vulnerabilities.

Example attack scenarios:

+ Components run with the same privileges as the application, which makes them a target for exploitation if they have flaws (e.g. a coding error or a backdoor).
+ Vulnerable components like CVE-2017-5638 can result in serious impact like remote code execution.
+ Devices like IoT devices can be difficult or impossible to patch and can be a security concern.
+ Attackers can use automated tools like Shodan IoT to find unpatched or misconfigured systems.

### A03:2021 – Injection

Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to pass untrusted data into a system and have the system execute it as code.

Prevention: 

To prevent injection attacks, the following measures can be taken:

+ Validate and sanitize all inputs: Inputs should be validated and sanitized to ensure they match the expected format and do not contain malicious code. This includes all types of inputs, such as user input, HTTP headers, and query parameters.

+ Use parameterized queries: Use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements, to separate data from code in database interactions. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks.

+ Escape characters and special characters: Escape characters and special characters to prevent code injection in HTML, XML, and other formats.

+ Keep software up to date: Regularly update all software, including frameworks, libraries, and databases, to ensure the latest security patches are installed.

In summary, the two attack scenarios both involve exploiting a vulnerability in an application that allows the attacker to inject malicious code into a SQL query. The application uses untrusted data to construct the query and fails to validate it, allowing the attacker to manipulate the query and gain access to sensitive information or control over the database. These scenarios highlight the importance of proper input validation and secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### EP 21: BLACK DUCK EGGS (Summary)

In this episode of Darknet Diaries, the host, Jack Rhysider, shares the story of Ira, a former spy and cyber security expert. The episode details how Ira, along with his team, was able to uncover a Chinese intelligence operation that was trying to steal sensitive information from a company. The company in question was working on important new technologies and mergers and acquisitions worth billions of dollars, making it a target for espionage.

Ira and his team conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment of the company's network, which involved blending into the surroundings and gathering information in a stealthy manner. After three days, Ira was able to present his findings to the CEO, showcasing the business value of the vulnerabilities found in terms of dollar amounts. This approach made the CEO take quick action as they could understand the impact of the vulnerabilities in terms of financial loss.

The FBI was later able to dismantle the Chinese intelligence operation, with numerous arrests made from the restaurant where the spies were located. Ira and his team's covert approach, avoiding any scenes or drawing attention to themselves, helped them blend into their surroundings and gather information effectively. This highlights the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and looking for any signs of espionage.

Years later, Ira asked the new CSO about the Chinese intelligence operation, and the CSO informed him that they had made a dozen arrests. Ira's story is just one of many that he has written about in his numerous books, including Spies Among Us and Advanced Persistent Security. These books offer valuable insights and advice on how to protect companies from attacks and spies. The host also recommends Stan's book, Through the Eyes of the Enemy, which is his autobiography and was co-authored by Ira.

In conclusion, this episode highlights the importance of conducting thorough vulnerability assessments, presenting the findings in a way that the decision-makers can understand, and being aware of one's surroundings to avoid falling victim to espionage. The story of Ira and his team's efforts to uncover a Chinese intelligence operation serves as a testament to the importance of cybersecurity and the role that experts like Ira play in keeping companies safe.

### Pick a CVE, and briefly explain it & why it matters

SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) 

SSRF is a vulnerability where a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL, allowing the attacker to access internal resources not meant for external access. This can result in sensitive information disclosure, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access to systems and networks. To prevent SSRF, network and application-layer security measures can be implemented such as firewall policies, validating user input, sanitizing client data, and allowing only a positive allow list. Attackers can use SSRF to access sensitive data, compromise internal services, and map internal networks. Additional measures such as network encryption and avoiding deploying security services on front systems can also be considered.

### b) SQL Injection Intro + WebGoat tasks

I have gained the basic understanding of SQL, how it works, and what it's used for; basic understanding of SQL injections and how they work. Additionally, I have worked on DML, DDL, DCL, string SQL injection, numeric SQL injection, violation of the CIA triad. 

SQL is a standardised programming language that is used for managing relational databases and performing various operations on the data in them. 


The most common SQL statemens such as Select, Insert, Update, Delete are used for acquiring the records from the databases. If anyone will attempt to use the DML (Data Manipulation Language), they will breach the three protection goals: confidentiality, integrity. 

DCL - Data control Language - used for creating privileges of accessing and manipulating the database. 

SQL Injection - the most common web hacking techniques that consist of insertion (injection) of the harmful code via the SQL query from the client to the application.
