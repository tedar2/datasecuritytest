## x) Read and summarize - OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

A05:2021 is a reference to OWASP Top 10 A1:2017, which is a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. "Security Misconfiguration" refers to a security vulnerability caused by inadequate or incorrect configuration of web application components such as the web server, application server, database server, or framework. Examples of security misconfiguration include:

+ Default accounts with well-known, easy-to-guess passwords
+ Unrestricted access to error messages containing sensitive information
+ Unsecured default configurations of application components
+ Unpatched vulnerabilities in software components

To mitigate security misconfiguration risks, it's important to follow best practices for configuring and securing web applications, such as:

+ Removing or disabling default accounts and changing passwords
+ Configuring error handling to not reveal sensitive information
+ Keeping software components up to date with security patches
+ Regularly reviewing and testing security configurations.
