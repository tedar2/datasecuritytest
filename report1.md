### Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains (summary)

#### Intro

+ a new class of threats emerged - "Advanced Persistent Threat" or APT 
+ conventional incident response methods fail to mitigate the risk with APT intrusions
+ APT actors continually demonstrate the capability to compromise systems by using advanced tools, customized malware, and "zero-day" exploits that anti-virus and patching cannot detect or mitigate
+ responses to APT intrusions reqiure an evolutions in analysis, process and technology
+ intelligence-driven, threat focused approach to study intrusions from the adversaries' perspective
+ each discrete phase is mapped to one step - detection, mitigation and response
+ "kill chain" - describes the structure of intrusion; throuhg this model, defenders can develop resilient mitigations against intruders 
+ "kill chain" (U.S. Department of Defence, 2007) stages are fix, track, target, engage, access

### Chapter 3.2 and 3.3 

+ a kill chain is a systematic process to target and engage an adversary to create desired effects
+ steps are find, fix, track, target, engage, assess (F2T2EA)
+ a new kill chain model, developed specifically for intrusions: the agressor must develop a payload ro breach a trusted boundary, establish a presence inside a trusted environment, and from that presence, take actions towards their objectives
