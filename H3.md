## x) Read and summarize: Costa-Gazcón 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting (chapter4: Mapping the adversary)

The article covers the following topics: 

+ The ATT&CK Framework
+ Mapping with ATT&CK
+ Testing yourself

The ATT&CK framework (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a publicly-accessible database of tactics and techniques used by cyber adversaries. It is maintained by MITRE Corporation and is used as a reference for threat analysis, incident response, and proactive defense. The framework provides a common language and understanding of cyber-attacks, enabling organizations to better detect and defend against these attacks by mapping them to specific tactics and techniques.

The ATT&CK framework outlines 14 tactics used by threat actors in an attack. The tactics cover different stages of an attack, including reconnaissance, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, exfiltration, and impact. Each tactic is comprised of specific techniques and sub-techniques that describe the behavior of the threat actor. The framework has recently been updated to improve the granularity of the sub-technique system and to avoid overlap between techniques. The procedures describe the specific way in which a threat actor implements a technique or sub-technique, and one procedure can expand into multiple techniques and sub-techniques.

The techniques contain the following information: a name, a list of subtechniques and their descriptions, the data source and a scorecard.

ATT&CK Navigator is a tool provided by MITRE to visualize the relationships between techniques, tactics, and software in the ATT&CK framework. It allows users to explore the matrix and understand the relationships between different techniques and tactics, and how these might apply to specific software. The Navigator provides a graphical representation of the ATT&CK matrix, making it easier to understand the relationships between different elements and how they can be used to defend against or detect cyber threats.

Mapping with ATT&CK

The exercise describes the process of mapping the behavior of the Formbook infostealer to the techniques and sub-techniques within the ATT&CK framework. The infostealer is described as a tool that can steal authorization and login credentials, keylog information even when victims use a virtual keyboard or auto-fill, and take screenshots. The exercise outlines the process of identifying the relevant tactics and techniques within the ATT&CK matrix, specifically T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores, T1555.003 – Credentials from Web Browsers, T1056 – Input Capture, T1056.001 – Keylogging, and T1113 – Screen Capture.

Testing yourself (bonus)

The malware sample "Formbook" is a botnet that infects victims and retrieves information from them to be managed in a web panel. Formbook was distributed via PDFs, DOC files, XLS files, and RTF files. The sample being analyzed is a RAR SFX archive that contains several files, including an AutoIt script (axo.exe) that decrypts and loads Formbook into memory. The script changes the folder attributes to hide its contents and modifies the registry key to remain persistent on the system. Formbook has various features, including an install manager, file browsing, full Unicode support, and the ability to receive commands from the C&C server to download and execute, update, visit URLs, take screenshots, and more.

The techniques found in the article include:
Defense Evasion & Privilege Escalation: Process Injection (Dynamic-link Library Injection, Portable Executable Injection)
Collection & Credential Access: Input Capture (Credential API Hooking)
Command and Control: Encrypted Channel
Discovery: File and Directory Discovery
Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter
Impact: System Shutdown/Reboot
Collection: Screen Capture
Initial Access: Phishing (Spearphishing Attachment, Spearphishing Link)
Execution: User Execution (Malicious Link, Malicious File)
Defense Evasion: Obfuscated Files or Information (Software Packing), Indicator Removal on Host (File Deletion), Hide Artifacts (Hidden Files and Directories)
Persistence & Privilege Escalation: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder)
Defense Evasion: Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Time Based Evasion, System Checks), Modify Registry, Impair Defenses (Disable or Modify Tools)
Defense Evasion & Privilege Escalation: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (Bypass User Access Control)
Discovery: Peripheral Device Discovery, Process Discovery, Software Discovery.
Some of the techniques are marked with an asterisk (*) indicating that they may be debatable in their classification.

## y) Write an answer with references of Mitre Att&ck, and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x.

+ Define tactic and give an example 

Tactic: Defense Evasion

<img width="972" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90892301/216818736-9d458bb0-42ca-4f99-ba1c-c04d71114e4c.png">

Defense Evasion is a tactic within the Mitre ATT&CK framework that refers to the steps taken by an attacker to avoid detection and make it harder for an organization's security measures to detect and stop the attack. The objective of defense evasion is to hide the malicious activity, making it harder for security products and incident response teams to detect and respond to the attack.

Defense evasion can be especially difficult to detect and prevent, since it often involves the abuse of legitimate tools and techniques. To combat defense evasion, organizations need to adopt a multi-layered security approach that includes endpoint protection, network security, and threat intelligence. Additionally, incident response plans should include steps for detecting and mitigating defense evasion techniques.

+ Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each

The chosen Technique and Subtechnique of Defense Evasion: T1055.001 - Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection

T1055.001 is a sub-technique under the Defense Evasion tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It refers to the act of injecting malicious code into a legitimate process using Dynamic Link Library (DLL) injection. This technique is used by attackers to evade detection by security tools as the malicious code is hidden within a trusted process. The sub-technique involves injecting the malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process, either by writing the code directly into the process's memory or by modifying the process's import address table to redirect execution to the injected code.

The goal of this technique is to elevate the attacker's privileges on the system, evade detection, and provide persistence on the compromised host. Some of the sub-techniques associated with T1055.001 include:

+ Define procedure, and give an example of each

DLL Search Order Hijacking: The attacker modifies the search order of a system's DLLs to load a malicious DLL instead of a legitimate one.
Reflective DLL Injection: The attacker injects a malicious DLL into memory without relying on the Windows Loader.
Process Hollowing: The attacker replaces the code of a legitimate process with malicious code and runs it in a suspended state.
Process Doppelgänging: A form of process hollowing that uses NTFS transactions to hide the process's replacement from disk.
DLL Sideloading: The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the way a legitimate process loads DLLs to inject a malicious DLL.
Overall, T1055.001 highlights the need for security tools to monitor and detect the injection of malicious code into legitimate processes, as well as the importance of keeping systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
